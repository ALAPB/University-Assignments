# University-Assignments
A repository to contain the code I wrote for university assignments (At Carleton University)

For context, I decided that it probably wouldn't hurt to add the files I made during courses I took in my program.
The assignments were written throughout 3 different courses:  
  BIT1400 - Into to Programming and Problem Solving  
  BIT2400 - Intermediate Programming and Problem Solving  
  NET2008 - DevOps  

Each course also had their own dedicated programming language:  
  BIT1400 - C  
  BIT2400 - C++  
  NET2008 - Python  
  
Some of the assignments in the BIT1400 and BIT2400 courses had started code provided to us. As a general rule, my own written code is included after the TODO sections.
In most of the .h and .cpp files, the code is entirely my own.
As for the Jupyter Labs/Notebook files, the instructions are present, as well as indicated sections where my own code is written.
